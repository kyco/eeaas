# Recommended workflow

There are many ways to use this package and here is an approach that will work for *any* project.

### 1. Create

Create CSS and JS files for your easter eggs and add them to your **public** folder. This way they won't get shipped to your users.

### 2. Register

Register your easter eggs by referencing the CSS and JS files in the egg's **`resources`** property. To ensure the triggers only activate at specific places in the app you can use the enabled property when registering the egg. This will force you to manually enable the egg before it can be activated.

### 3. Enable and start

Once your egg is enabled (either via the `.enable()` method or the `enabled` property) call the **`.start()`** method. This will then trigger the easter egg and start injecting the resources into the DOM.

### 4. Clean up

Once the easter egg has run its course call the **`.stop()`** method and clean up any logic that should not be there anymore. By default the CSS and JS resources which were injected into the DOM will be removed from the DOM. However, any JavaScript that gets executed will remain in memory and you will have to manually clean it up.
